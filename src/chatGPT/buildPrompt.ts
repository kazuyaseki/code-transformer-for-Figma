- import components from @/components directory
- if string value other than hex or rgb() format is specified for color property, it is design token vairable. it is defined with the name in kebab-case in tailwind.config.js
- if "typography" property is specified, it is defined in tailwind config as typography token that has multiple properties such as font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height
- if a layer contains more than 1 same name child layers, define it with ul tag and create array of appropriate dummy data within React component and use map method to render in JSX
- use export rather than default export
- if Props summaries are provided for the components used in JSON, write props that are required in code props and omit props that only exist in Figma JSON
- if child is chunk, render it as ${getChunkReplaceMarker(
    'nodeId of chunk'
  )}, it will later be used to replace with another code
- if there are components without Props summaries, just write as <ComponentName /> with properties in Figma variant
